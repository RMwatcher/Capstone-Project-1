  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Before I got into programming, I was working as a cook for a hotel restaurant for 12+ years when I first started
    back in 2008. It was 2018 when I made the decision to go back to school and pursuit a degree in web development at
    Clark College full-time while working full time.</p>

  <p>Two years into the program, the pandemic occurred which forced everyone to work and learn from home, which was a
    learning experience. I finished the program online and decided to spend one more year at Clark in order to transfer
    to Washington State University Vancouver the following year where I graduated with highest honors in 2023.</p>

  <p>Though I'm experienced in Front-end Web Development, I wanted to get into Back-End Web Development as well as
    ethical hacking thus, beginning my journey here at Udemy.</p>
